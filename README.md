# GuitarGlove
1.Idea

Our idea is to create an assistive guitar learning experience through a smart glove. Each finger of the glove will have 6 LEDs representing the 6 strings of the guitar. These LEDs will light up to indicate where each finger should be placed on the strings. The glove will also have sensors to detect the hand's position and will only light up the LEDs when the hand is in the correct position to play the chord (correct fret ). This glove will connect to a guitar learning website, allowing the user to choose the chord they want to play and making learning guitar more intuitive and engaging.

2.Problem Statement

Learning the guitar is not easy: teachers are expensive, musical notes are hard to understand, and remembering each chord is difficult. So we created a cheap alternative for children, while helping with making learning chords more intuitive and creating a fun experience for users

3.SDGs in play

Our project aligns with SDG 4 (Quality Education) by making music education more accessible and interaactive. It also supports SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) by using technology to create an innovative educational tool.

4.Constraints

1. The glove has to be attachable to any guitar, so portability is an important factor
2. The case had to be sturdy since movements in the ultrasonic sensor could give incorrect readings
3. It needed to be aesthetically pleasing, as users would not want to attach an unattractive product to their guitar or wear an unattractive glove.
4. We needed to find an easy way to attach the sensor to the guitar

5.Solutions Brainstorming

We first decided to use an actuator to create a device that could move your fingers to the correct chords, however, we could not produce enough torque. Then we thought of making the guitar light up depending on where your fingers had to go, but that had already been innovated. Then we thought to make a glove that is attached to the guitar and moves horizontally across the fretboard to the right position and LEDs that later indicate which strings have to be pressed, however after talking to our mentors we decided to go with our current idea.

6.Final Solution

The GuitarGlove

Design Process

For the design, we curated an acrylic box that would fit around the ultrasonic sensor and laser-cut it via Makercase. We had multiple iterations and once we were sure, we laser-cut it
